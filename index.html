			<b> NWIT101 Chatbot Team Project </b>
		</p>
		<b> ABSTRACT: </b>
		<p>
		The Chatbot is a useful way to learn about IoT because it involves consideration of user interface, input and output, and block programming which are key characteristics of the field. By each of us contributing to programming decisions and tasks we will be creating a chatbot using block code on Scratch3. This will provide an opportunity for us to learn how to program and create a chatbot using the blockcode and visual design software in Scratch 3.  We will not need to purchase any materials, but will use the internet to access Scratch 3 and the chatbot and our laptops. We envision our project being like a basic interactive game that helps individuals learn basic programming understanding through the chatbot. Then, with a good understanding of the project we will form a website to encompass and explain the project(game).
